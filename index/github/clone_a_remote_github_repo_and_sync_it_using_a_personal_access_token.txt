====== clone a remote github repo and sync it using a personal access token ======
Created Friday 05 November 2021

**How to clone a remote github repo to your local machine and sync it using a personal access token:**
1. Setup connecting to github via ssh using these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
2. Create a personal access token using these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
3. Clone the github repo using the HTTPS method described here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
	a. To use the instructions of 3, you MUST create as least one file in the repo, so choose to add a README file during the repo creation process.
4. Make at least one change to your local copy of the remote repo.
5. Push the change to the remote repo, as described here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository
	a. When you enter the "git push origin main" command in a terminal, you will be prompted for your github username and your personal access token.
6. If you don't want to enter your username and token every time, use [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret|libsecret]] and [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring|gnome-keyring]] to store them securely: [[git:use gnome keyring as git credential helper]]
